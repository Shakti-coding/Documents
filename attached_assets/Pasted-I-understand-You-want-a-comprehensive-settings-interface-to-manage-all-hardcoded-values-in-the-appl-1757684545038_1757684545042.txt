I understand! You want a comprehensive settings interface to manage all hardcoded values in the application. Let me create this system for you.

Created task list

Decided on settings page approach

Searched for "Find all hardcoded values like API keys, session strings, phone numbers, URLs, and configuration values throughout the application"

Decided on settings interface structure

Opened client/src/lib/telegram.ts

Opened server/storage.ts

Opened client/src/components/auth-modal.tsx

Planned settings interface development (4 seconds)
Now I'll create the comprehensive settings interface that shows all hardcoded values and allows you to manage them. Let me create the settings page:


Created client/src/pages/settings.tsx

Find all hidden information in code

Planned navigation and API updates
Now let me add the settings page to the navigation and create the backend functionality to actually update the hardcoded values:


Opened client/src/App.tsx

Edited App.tsx structure

Edited client/src/App.tsx

Edited client/src/App.tsx

Planned navigation and backend changes
Now let me add the settings link to the navigation and create the backend API to actually update hardcoded values:


Opened client/src/components/sidebar.tsx

Decided on settings link placement
Checked console and system logs

Planned API endpoint creation
Great! The settings page is working. Now let me create the backend API endpoints to actually update the hardcoded values in files:


Opened server/routes.ts

Found settings API endpoint location

Opened server/routes.ts

Found settings API endpoint location

Executed rg -n 'Test endpoint' server/routes.ts

Executed rg -n 'app\.get.*test' server/routes.ts

Planned API endpoint locations
Checked code issues

Executed rg -B 10 -n 'return httpServer' server/routes.ts

Added settings API endpoints

Edited server/routes.ts

Planned frontend API integration
Now let me update the frontend settings page to fetch data from the backend APIs I just created:


Completed task list update

Create page for settings and options

Show and change hidden information

Update hidden information everywhere it's used

Add menu for copying, clearing, info

Manage custom settings, save them

Track all changes made to values

Export settings to files

Link settings page to main menu
